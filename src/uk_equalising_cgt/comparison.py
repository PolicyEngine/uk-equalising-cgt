"""Static data: other institutions' revenue estimates for CGT-income-tax
equalisation (not all model the identical package).

- CenTax (Advani, Lonsdale & Summers 2024): equalisation PLUS base broadening
  (death-uplift removal, rebasing on arrival / exit charge, investment
  allowance); retention-rate elasticity 1.0 (range 0.5-2.0); ~£14bn/yr
  central, £9.6bn worst-case.
- Advani & Summers (2020, CAGE): taxing gains at income tax rates, static:
  £16.7bn/yr.
- HMRC ready reckoner: +10pp on higher CGT rates only, implied very high
  elasticity (unpublished): -£2bn/yr by year 3 (loses revenue).
- OBR baseline: CGT receipts under current policy, ~£16.2bn/yr (2025-26).
